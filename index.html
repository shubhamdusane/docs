<p>USDAO is a fully crypto asset backed stable currency by USDAO Decentralized Autonomous Organization. A digital token intended to serve as a global currency. USDAO brings together familiar concepts into a never-before seen protocol.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>In order to create a stablecoin that meets the requirements of businesses and
enterprises, it is important that not only it is competent enough against traditional solutions but also present significant improvements over them. We offer USDAO stablecoin as a solution to the above problem. USDAO stablecoin has been designed to keep simplicity, interoperability, and business compatibility at its core. IntegratingUSDAO as a payment channel into your existing business or enterprise use case issimpler than the leading payment solutions available today. All you need is ablockchain wallet with an account to send and receive payments in USDAO to get started. The process is simpler compared to traditional solutions which include registrations, kyc, complex integrations and high transaction fees.</p>
<p>Unlike many other existing stablecoins like USDT and USDC we offer 100%
transparency in accountings and a robust governance mechanism which shall be fully decentralized and run by an open community. We have also removed the unfair and unnecessary burden of overcollateralization mechanism of assets for minting tokens like Dai does. Instead we bring a fairer and robust protocol to maintain the pool stability. </p>
<p>The USDAO pool mechanism assures that the pool never gets
undercollateralized and users are never threatened of forced liquidation.
Above all, unlike its rivals USDAO comes up with an ecosystem of use cases. The
USDAO stablecoin is one crucial element to the financial architecture we are building.</p>
<p>The details of such use cases are mentioned in the respective sections below. The presence of USDAO on multiple blockchains and combining its interoperability and compatibility it becomes a one stop destination for truly decentralized robust, safe and secure financial solutions that are industry ready. Before moving onto USDAO workflow let’s dive into some of its important and crucial components and terminologies. All prices are denominated in ether. These prices are computed by consulting ETH/USD price oracles, except when otherwise stated. Since the stablecoin is deployed on multiple blockchains the keyword ERC20 is used in general form. Every such statement is true for all the other protocols like BEP20 or TRC20 for Binance Smart Chain and Tron respectively.</p>
<h1 id="components-terminologies">Components &amp; Terminologies<a class="headerlink" href="#components-terminologies" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p><strong>USDAO</strong> is a two token protocol which are linked with each other via smart contract which powers the whole USDAO ecosystem. The Governance token helps in maintaining the protocol more decentralized.</p>
<h3 id="usdao-">USDAO   -<a class="headerlink" href="#usdao-" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>This is the actual stablecoin whose price is pegged relatively to 1 US dollar. It can be minted using either Ether or other specific ERC20 tokens. The amount of token minted depends upon the median ETH/USD price returned by the oracles used by the system at the time of the transaction.</p>
<h3 id="asset-">ASSET   -<a class="headerlink" href="#asset-" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The primary role of the ASSET token is to allow investors to fund the reserve pool with Ether and help USDAO maintain its price pegged to 1 US dollar regardless of any market fluctuations. The price of the ASSET token also varies proportionally to the Ether price.</p>
<h3 id="daogov-">DAOGOV -<a class="headerlink" href="#daogov-" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>DGOVN Token  is the  Governance token of the protocol aimed to distribute governance rights / voting rights for USDAO ecosystem. DGOVN can be acquired by participating at the sale of tokens or through or by a USDAO community campaign. The funds raised by the governance token DGOVN , 100% of the raised amount would be shifted to stabilize the USDAO pool.</p>
<h2 id="reserve-pool-">Reserve Pool -<a class="headerlink" href="#reserve-pool-" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The Ether that is deposited during the minting operation of either USDAO or ASSET
token is deposited into the USDAO smart contract, also known as, the reserve pool. The reserve pool is the backbone of the whole system as it determines the health of the economy of the system. It helps determine the price of the ASSET token as well as determine the debt ratio.</p>
<h2 id="mint-price-">Mint Price   -<a class="headerlink" href="#mint-price-" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Mint price is the price at which USDAO stablecoin is minted against Ether. It is
relatively pegged to 1 US dollar worth of Ether. The current price at the time of
minting one dollar's worth of ether, determined by the median ETH/USD price
returned from the oracles.</p>
<p>The mint price may be subject to fluctuation from its base price of 1 US dollar. This is intentional and is important to discourage any arbitraging opportunities.</p>
<h2 id="burn-price-">Burn price   -<a class="headerlink" href="#burn-price-" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Burn price is the price at which the user withdraws back his Ether against the
stablecoins. Equivalent to the minting price the burn price is decided by the current ETH/USD prices returned from the oracles. The current price at the time of burning one dollar's worth of ether, determined by the median ETH/USD price returned from the oracles.
Fund Price Fund price is the price at which the ASSET token is available to be minted against Ether. Unlike USDAO mint price, fund price is not pegged to any constant value. Its price can vary and is proportional to the current ETH/USD price.</p>
<h2 id="defund-price-">Defund Price -<a class="headerlink" href="#defund-price-" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Defund price is exactly the reverse of the fund price. It is the price at which investors can get their Ether back by redeeming the Asset tokens back to the system.</p>
<h2 id="debt-ratio-">Debt Ratio   -<a class="headerlink" href="#debt-ratio-" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>In its simplest mathematical representation, the debt ratio is basically the ratio of the total number of stablecoins out in the market to the US dollar value of the reserve pool.</p>
<p>The debt ratio signifies the ratio of the amount of buy and sell activities of USDAO stablecoin in the market at that point of time. In other words, if the debt ratio is, let’s say, 50% that is equivalent to say that for every 100 US dollars worth of Ether present in the system there are 50 stablecoins (worth 50 USD) out in the market. This also means that should each token be burnt right now for Ether the system has sufficient collateral in the pool to pay everybody back.</p>
<p>The debt ratio of 100% or above is an alarming situation for the system because it means the system does not have enough Ether to return to users in case of 100%
USDAO token withdrawal. Hence at this stage, the users receive Ether which is in
proportion to the amount of tokens they are withdrawing and the amount of Ether
available in the pool.</p>
<h2 id="max-debt-ratio-">MAX Debt Ratio   -<a class="headerlink" href="#max-debt-ratio-" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>When the debt ratio goes above 80% the defund of ASSET is disabled until the debt
ratio falls below 80%. This is important to prevent funders from emptying the pool completely so as to protect the financial interests of USDAO users. Hence, the 80% debt ratio is the Max Debt Ratio of the system for ASSET token holders.</p>
<h2 id="oracles-">Oracles  -<a class="headerlink" href="#oracles-" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>An oracle is a reliable source of ETH/USD price. Our system currently fetches the
ETH/USD price from three oracles - Chainlink, Uniswap V2, and Compound oracle.
These oracles are an indispensable part of the whole system as it determines the mint, burn, fund, and defund prices. The debt ratio is also determined by the prices returned by the oracles.
The reason to use three oracles is to protect the system against any malfunction or inaccuracy in any individual oracle. The system calculates the median price returned by these three oracles, which is further used in operations like mint, burn, etc.</p>
<h1 id="importance">Importance<a class="headerlink" href="#importance" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Crypto assets are known for their high volatility which renders them unsuitable for medium of exchange. A stable cryptocurrency strives to become a medium of exchange by suppressing volatility and maintaining a constant value through time. This innovation allows for individuals and businesses to enter into future agreements at a known cost. Just as one US Dollar today is equal to one dollar tomorrow, people can transact knowing they will have a certain fixed cost.</p>
<h1 id="accomplishments">Accomplishments<a class="headerlink" href="#accomplishments" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>The USDAO Stablecoin System has been operating in Beta mode since its launch in July 2021 . The Beta mode allows for a single collateral type, Ether.</p>
<h1 id="next">Next<a class="headerlink" href="#next" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Multi-Collateral USDAO is the next and full version of the USDAO Stablecoin System. In this system, all ERC-20 tokens are capable of being used as collateral for USDAO. Governance token (DGOV) holders will be responsible for voting in and setting risk parameters for each collateral type. The scope of collateral types are as wide as tokens issued on the Ethereum platform. IN addition to it USDAO protocol will be available on all the major blockchains.</p>
<h1 id="how-it-works">How it works<a class="headerlink" href="#how-it-works" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The USDAO stablecoin is designed to be pegged to 1 US dollar. The two operations, mint and burn, help it maintain its peg. When either of these two activities increases more than the other the USDAO mint or burn price rises up or falls down slightly in order to discourage any more such operation. However, ideally in stable market
conditions, if a user deposits x dollar worth of Ether into the system he shall receive x amount of USDAO stablecoins. Conversely, if a user deposits x amount of stablecoins back into the system he shall receive x US dollar worth of Ether back in his wallet.
The prices for all such operations are determined by the median price of three oracles
- Chainlink Eth/USD price, Uniswap V2, and Compound oracle.</p>
<p>However, since the price of Ether is constantly volatile it is required to maintain the US dollar value of the reserve pool always greater than the amount of stablecoins out in the market. This is made possible by the second token called the ASSET token. ASSET tokens allow investors to fund the system with Ethers to keep the system always healthy. Similar to USDAO, the holders of ASSET tokens can also buy (or fund) and sell (or defund) their tokens. However, the ASSET token is a token that assumes the risks and harvest the benefits. It gives investors a unique opportunity to not only scale their profit but also earn share in revenue.</p>
<p>The exchange rate for the above operation is determined by a set of oracles.</p>
<p>The protocol also has pool contracts that hold collateral (ETH) and other features like secure transactions, that allows the protocol to prevent fraud from any party with the use of strong cryptographic techniques which makes this protocol more secure and safe over the public blockchain.</p>
<p>USDAO can be used for everyday means of exchange, a store of value, market entry, and most commonly, to provide a less volatile holding ground for investors and traders during the upswings and crashes of the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<h2 id="advantages">Advantages<a class="headerlink" href="#advantages" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><strong>Resourceful documentation, APIs and tools to build applications easily and
elegantly on top of USDAO system</strong> - We are providing a rich content for the
documentation, libraries and APIs along with tutorials to the developer
community to build applications on top of USDAO. The resources will be
compatible with all the major programming languages that are popular in
blockchain development. This promises a continuous innovation &amp;
development of innumerous applications in future.</p>
<p><strong>Simplified integration and user friendly tools</strong> - We have emphasized heavily
on keeping the complexity of the applications away from user experience. The
applications and tools built on USDAO stablecoin are very simple to integrate
into any web or mobile application. All our applications are designed to be cross
OS platforms, cross browser platforms with minimal clicks and dependencies.
We are also providing simple documentations, video tutorials and support to
simplify integration of our apps on your platform easily and with minimal
technical knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Robust architecture and strong peg to 1 USD</strong> - The pool mechanism is designed
in such a way to always grow in value without putting any financial pressure on
either users or investors. This ensures the stablecoin is always strongly pegged
to 1 USD by keeping the debt ratio always low. The system is also designed to
keep a balance between the number of mints and burns and punishes too much
arbitrage activity committed in a short period of time. It is designed to keep the collateral position stronger irrespective of market bullish or bearish run.</p>
<p><strong>Governed by a 100 percent decentralized community</strong> - Any person with
governance tokens has the right to create, vote, or delegate proposals which
can make important and crucial changes depending on the future requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Presence in multiple blockchains</strong> - USDAO and its applications are deployed in
multiple blockchains including Ethereum and others. As more improved and
better blockchain platforms emerge in future we shall mark our presence there
as well.</p>
<p><strong>Available in multiple pairs and on all major exchanges</strong> - USDAO shall be
available to all the major exchanges of the world including both centralized and
decentralized exchanges. It shall also be available in as many pairs as possible
notably USDAO/ETH, USDAO/BTC and many more.</p>

<h1 id="decentralized-governance">Decentralized Governance<a class="headerlink" href="#decentralized-governance" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Inspired by the Compound governance protocol, we developed a decentralized
governance architecture that is aimed to serve as the sole decision-making body for future changes in the USDAO stablecoin system. This is important to make USDAO protocol a completely decentralized system with no single individual or institution having full control over it.</p>
<p>Depending upon the changes we face in the future it is important to have features that allow necessary changes to be made for the welfare of the stablecoin. However,when the world is moving towards complete decentralization we didn’t want to be left behind. </p>
<p>Hence, we decided to build this decentralized governance system.
We may decide to make the ASSET token the governance token. This is a subject of
discussion currently.</p>
<h2 id="key-concepts-in-governance-protocol">Key concepts in governance protocol<a class="headerlink" href="#key-concepts-in-governance-protocol" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<h3 id="governance-token">Governance Token<a class="headerlink" href="#governance-token" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The governance token is an ERC20 token that is required to participate in governance protocol. Any individual or entity with governance tokens in their wallet can create, delegate or vote a proposal. The amount of governance tokens in the wallet determines the weight of the voting right of that individual. More the token the person has in his wallet, the more weightage he has in voting</p>
<h2 id="delegation">Delegation<a class="headerlink" href="#delegation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Mere owning of governance tokens does not allow the token holder to create or vote on a proposal. The token holder must first delegate his voting rights to either his own address or to someone else's address.</p>
<h2 id="proposal">Proposal<a class="headerlink" href="#proposal" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>A proposal is an executable code that, if run, would make the proposed changes in the functioning of the USDAO stablecoin system. To create a proposal at least 1% of the governance token must be delegated to the proposer’s address. A typical proposal consists of functions along with their parameters that get executed should the proposal succeed, Ether sent along with the proposal and a description regarding the purpose or motive behind the proposal. A proposal is subjected to a 3-day voting period after which it may or may not be accepted.</p>
<h2 id="voting">Voting<a class="headerlink" href="#voting" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>People whose addresses have been delegated to vote for a proposal may choose to vote for or against a proposal. The votes can be cast only if the proposal is in an inactive state. Votes can be cast immediately by the cast vote feature or later using the castVoteBySig feature. There are a total of 10 million governance tokens. If a minimum of 4% of the total votes have participated and the majority of the votes casted is in favor of the proposal the proposal is queued in the timelock. If not, the proposal is rejected. The voting period is 3 days.</p>
<h2 id="timelock">Timelock<a class="headerlink" href="#timelock" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Once a proposal is accepted it is not immediately executed. Rather it is queued in the timelock where it sits for the next 2 days. After 2 days, the proposal is executed and the changes can be observed publicly. This is important because the period of 2 days can be used by the community to notify the general users of USDAO stablecoin about the incoming changes through various platforms. The proposals only get rescinded when they do not meet enough votes in its favour. We assure that over a period of time the governance model will be truly decentralized and owned by a community of very learned and passionate people like you. The governance tokens shall also be distributed to our members building successful use cases for USDAO like startups and others. The foundation assures everyone to follow the best practices to build and maintain the USDAO community.</p>
<h1 id="potential-use-cases">Potential Use cases<a class="headerlink" href="#potential-use-cases" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>As mentioned earlier the prime motivation to create USDAO stablecoin was to create a stablecoin that could facilitate business processes. A stablecoin that could be easily integrable with minimum hassle and should enable multiple business use cases. We have identified various use cases for our stablecoin along with their own roadmaps.</p>
<p><strong>Staking</strong></p>
<p>Staking is the act of locking cryptocurrencies to receive rewards. It involves holding funds in a cryptocurrency wallet to support the security and operations of a blockchain network. Simple, staking is the act of locking cryptocurrency to receive rewards.
Since every single USDAO token is a debt on the system we have to reduce the reward as the debt ratio rises to minimise the debt. This is the relationship between Debt ratio and Staking interest rate.</p>
<p><strong>Startups funding</strong></p>
<p>ICOs were a big deal back in 2017. It is a great concept but lacks security. However, since anybody could launch their own ICO with little technical knowledge, hundreds of untrusted and Ponzi schemes flooded the ICO market which soon became scams. With the vision to secure ICOs and uplift valuable startups with true potential, we intend to provide a trustless platform for both legitimate startups and global investors.</p>
<p><strong>Payment solutions</strong></p>
<p>The dream of a truly global stablecoin cannot be achieved unless it replaces fiat
currencies as the preferred payment asset. We intend to provide the merchants of the world with the enormous potential of blockchain technology in its most simplified form. We envisage providing a better and safer payment method alternative to the giant but centralized fiat institutions. We are offering simple APIs and widgets that can be used to quickly start accepting
payments in USDAO across the globe. Similar to popular centralized payment channel services like ApplePay, GooglePay, we would soon provide a web interface with rich transaction data and other important information regarding payment activities.</p>
<p><strong>Game economics</strong></p>
<p>The concept of tokens and payments have existed even before the advent of stablecoins. And as such there cannot be any better marriage of the blockchain and gaming industry as it not only makes the gaming experience safer but also trustless. More importantly, the true potential of using USDAO stablecoin with games comes from the fact that more smart contracts can be developed on top of gaming logic integrating more complex yet rich gaming features using our stablecoin.</p>
<p>A USDAO integration into a game shall provide opportunity for a trusteless token
economics including in-app purchases and asset transfers. In games that require
trust, such as betting, users can participate honestly and with assurance of a fair gameplay.</p>

<p>We are excited to inform the developer community that we would be regularly hosting several events like hackathons, seminars and online tutorials to spread and share our knowledge with everyone. We are looking forward to seeing independent developers and programmers build applications on top of USDAO stablecoin and amaze us with their solutions. In order to simplify the development process we are developing a separate section for developers. The section will include necessary documentation, APIs list, widget integration, code examples and everything relevant for further development.</p>
<p>We also host a platform to fund budding startups. Major part of the funding shall
happen with the stablecoin itself. We invite innovators and crazy minds from all
around the world to share their ideas or applications built on top of our stablecoin. </p>
<p>We are ready to fund the next million dollar idea.</p>
